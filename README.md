This is a fork of minidlna 1.1.4 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/minidlna/)

Some DLNA clients display album tracks in alphabetical order instead of album
track order.  This version of minidlna forces album tracks to be displayed
in album track order unless the client specifically requests the 
tracks to be sorted in aphabetical order.
